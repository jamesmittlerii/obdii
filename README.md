**Rheosoft OBD2**

Rheosoft OBD2 is a CarPlay OBD2 viewer.

It is designed to show diagnostic codes, monitors and sensor data.

The OBD2 interface uses a [forked](https://github.com/jamesmittlerii/SwiftOBD2) version of the Swift OBD2 library by [kkonteh97](https://github.com/kkonteh97/SwiftOBD2).

The UI is based on below's [CarSample](https://github.com/below/CarSample) which is the sample from the WWDC 2020 Talk [Accelerate your app with CarPlay](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/10635).
