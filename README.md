**Rheosoft OBD2**

Rheosoft OBD2 is a CarPlay-enabled OBD-II viewer focused on reporting diagnostic trouble codes, readiness monitors, and live sensor data.

The OBD2 interface uses a [forked](https://github.com/jamesmittlerii/SwiftOBD2) version of the Swift OBD2 library by [kkonteh97](https://github.com/kkonteh97/SwiftOBD2).

The user interface builds on Apple’s CarSample from the WWDC20 session “[Accelerate your app with CarPlay](https://github.com/below/CarSample),” and was extensively rewritten to support both CarPlay templates and SwiftUI views.
